            <h2>About me </h2>
            <p> Hi, I'm Muhammed Ebrahim, a third year Computer Science student at the University of the Witwatersrand. Hey there! I'm a curious soul with a passion for exploring new ideas and making connections. Whether it's diving deep into the latest tech trends, getting lost in a good book, or having a laugh with friends, I’m always up for something exciting. I believe in living life with a bit of adventure, a touch of creativity, and a whole lot of positivity. When I’m not working on my latest project, you can find me enjoying nature, experimenting in the kitchen, or binge-watching a series that’s way too good to stop. Let’s connect, share stories, and see where this journey takes us!</p>

            <h3>Latest Projects</h3>
            <h3>1. Task Management App</h3>
            <p>I built a task management app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks while categorizing them by priority and due date. It helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic local storage for saving data, and it gave me a practical understanding of full-stack concepts.</p>
            <h3>2. To-Do List Web App</h3>
            <p>I built a to-do list web app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. I integrated local storage so the tasks persist even when the page is reloaded. This project helped me practice JavaScript functions, array manipulation, and DOM updates, while improving my skills in organizing data and handling user interactions.</p>
            <h3>3. Weather App</h3>
            <p>I created a weather application that pulls real-time data using an API. The app displays the current weather, temperature, and forecast based on the user's location. This project helped me deepen my understanding of APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and handling user inputs effectively.</p>
