My name is Muhammed Ebrahim Suleman, 2719933, and this was my first time with hands on exposure using github and the terminal to complete tasks.The process of completing this lab was as follows:
step 1 - setting your Git identity which is required before making commits.
step 2 - Creates the necessary files for the assignment which stores student id, a brief report and your html file.
step 3 - Saved the changes with the specified commit message.
step 5 -  Creating and switching to  new branch.
step 6 - Committing the changes made with a meaningful message.
 step 7 - Merging changes from the featured branches into main.
 step 8 - Connectting your local repository to GitHub and pushing your work to GitHub for deployment.
 step 9 - Deploying your work.
 step 10 - Creating a Git bundle file containing the full repository for submission.
